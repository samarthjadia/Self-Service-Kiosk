# Self-Service-Kiosk
Coffee Kiosk Portal is a full-stack web application designed to enhance the ordering experience in coffee shops by providing a streamlined, online portal for customers, staff, and administrators. This application addresses language barriers, speeds up service time, and improves overall customer satisfaction by mimicking a coffee shop's UI, allowing all interactions to be conducted online.

The application supports multiple user roles, each authenticated through Spring Security. Customers can place orders, make payments, and track their orders for pickup. Staff members have the ability to manage inventory by creating and updating ingredients, develop new recipes for menu items, and fulfill customer orders. Administrators oversee user authentication and have control over enabling or disabling menu items.

Coffee Kiosk Portal is built with a robust technology stack: Java Spring Boot handles the backend operations, MySQL manages data storage, and AngularJS provides a dynamic and interactive user interface. For API testing, Insomnia is used to ensure the endpoints function correctly.

By resolving language barriers and automating the order process, Coffee Kiosk Portal reduces wait times and increases service speed, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and encouraging repeat business. This application is designed to meet the needs of a busy coffee shop environment, offering a seamless and intuitive ordering experience for all users.
